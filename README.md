# pick6-simulator

Fox has a game called Pick-6 where users guess the outcomes of sports games for a chance to win money. Me and my grandpa made an entry, and I told him that there were 1.5 million total entries. He marveled at the amount of computing power that must be required to store and process that much data. So I made this app to simulate the game to show him that it doesn't take much computing power. It takes about 6 seconds to run on my low spec Chromebook. 

I just threw this together based on an old project, so there are still remnants of that in here.
